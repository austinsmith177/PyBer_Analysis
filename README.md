# PyBer Analysis
#### **Overview**
- The purpose of this challenge was to take two seperate csv files, and combine them into one dataframe. Using the combination of the files we had multiple criteria to meet, and see the results of each city type with that criteria. 

#### **Results**
 - The results are a line graph coresponding the month with fares in USD for each city type. At first glance, it is easy to determine that rural areas do not contribute to much earnings, while urban areas contribute the most earnings. They all have a peak towards the end of February, but other than that they stay pretty consistant within a dollar range. Urban city types have taken a dip at the very end of the graph, which is the beginning of May, but it is hard to say if it will continue to drop or go back up without any other information to look at.
 
#### **Summary**
- **Recommendation One**
- - My first recommendation would be to look at the rural city type. We would need to determine the gross margin and figure out what percentage of money we are making/losing due to the low contribution to earnings. 
- **Recommendation Two**
- - My second recommendation would be to look at end of the urban city type, when we start to see the dip in May. We need to see if this a trend, or if something else is going on causing the drop. 
- - **Recommendation Three**
- - My third recommendation would be to take a larger sample of data, over a longer time period. If we had past years information, would could have a better understanding of how the ride shares for 2019 compare to previous years.
